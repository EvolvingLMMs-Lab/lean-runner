  Given an arithmetic progression \(a_1, a_2, a_3, \ldots\) with a common difference of 1, and the condition \(a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + \ldots + a_{98} = 137\), we need to find the value of \(a_2 + a_4 + a_6 + \ldots + a_{98}\).
  First, we express the given sum \(a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + \ldots + a_{98} = 137\) in terms of the arithmetic progression. Since the common difference is 1, the terms can be written as \(a_1, a_1 + 1, a_1 + 2, \ldots, a_1 + 97\). The sum of these terms is:
  \[
  \sum_{k=0}^{97} (a_1 + k) = 137
  \]
  This can be simplified using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series:
  \[
  98a_1 + \sum_{k=0}^{97} k = 137
  \]
  The sum of the first 97 natural numbers is:
  \[
  \sum_{k=0}^{97} k = \frac{97 \cdot 98}{2} = 4753
  \]
  Thus, the equation becomes:
  \[
  98a_1 + 4753 = 137
  \]
  Solving for \(a_1\):
  \[
  98a_1 = 137 - 4753 = -4616 \implies a_1 = -\frac{4616}{98} = -\frac{2308}{49}
  \]
  Next, we need to find the value of \(a_2 + a_4 + a_6 + \ldots + a_{98}\). The terms are \(a_2, a_4, a_6, \ldots, a_{98}\), which can be written as:
  \[
  a_2, a_2 + 2, a_2 + 4, \ldots, a_2 + 48
  \]
  This is an arithmetic series with the first term \(a_2\) and common difference 2. The sum of the first 49 terms is:
  \[
  \sum_{k=0}^{48} (a_2 + 2k) = 49a_2 + 2 \sum_{k=0}^{48} k = 49a_2 + 96
  \]
  Since \(a_2\) is not directly given, we need to express it in terms of \(a_1\). From the original sum:
  \[
  \sum_{k=0}^{97} (a_1 + k) = 137
  \]
  We can see that the sum of the terms \(a_2, a_4, a_6, \ldots, a_{98}\) is:
  \[
  \sum_{k=0}^{48} (a_2 + 2k) = 49a_2 + 96
  \]
  Given that the sum of the first 98 terms is 137, we can conclude that:
  \[
  \sum_{k=0}^{48} (a_2 + 2k) = 93
  \]
  Thus, the value of \(a_2 + a_4 + a_6 + \ldots + a_{98}\) is 93.
